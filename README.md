Some code I wrote to vastly improve the Miami Country Day School student portal.
This is a side project of mine that I occasionally work on, so updates may be infrequent.
This is not officially endorsed by MCDS, and things may break.

Want to support my work and future updates? <br /><br />

> Since MyCountryDay runs on Blackbaud these scripts might work on other Blackbaud school sites.

Have any suggestions? Bugs? Hmu on Snap `aosceola56` or on Discord `datgamer56`

## Features

- Old assignment center
- Dark Mode
- Ultrawide Mode (for large screens, experimental)
- Better messages page
- Better Directory
- Various QOL tweaks (i.e. Classes are in order by track, etc)
- Overall site cleanup
- ...more coming soon!

# Coming soon
- Custom Profiles
- Themes?
- Firefox support

> [!NOTE]
> Dark mode (and by extension, custom themes that I may implement) will never be perfect. <br />
> Many people have access to menus which I never will, and thus won't be able to change. (Ex: parents, teachers, athletes, etc) <br />
> While I have tried to make dark mode the best as I can get it, there will still be pages that won't be affected. <br />
> If you have any menus or areas that haven't been working on dark mode, please reach out to me! <br />

## How to install

***Google Chrome:***

1. Install the [`User Javascript and CSS`](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en&pli=1) extension.
2. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/aosceola27/MCDTweaks/releases/latest).
3. Download the `MCDTweaks-vX.X-CHROME-min.json` file.
4. [Enable Developer Mode in the extensions menu.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/userScripts?hl=en#developer_mode_for_extension_users)
5. Open the extension, click "Settings", then head to "Extension Settings" (third tab from the top on the left)
6. Under "Local Storage", hit `Upload JSON` and upload the .json file.

> [!WARNING]
> Unfortunately, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari aren't supported at the moment, sorry! <br />
> Additionally, this plugin will not work on the school computers, as MCDS blocked all extensions on them. (why mcds)
> Currently, I'm actively trying to get this approved by IT for use on the school computers. I'll give an update soon.

Special thanks to Blair and Reece for helping and testing this
